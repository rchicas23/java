PRACTICE 05 


1) Implement a method named roll. The method generates a random integer named number in the range from 
    1 – 100 inclusive.    The method returns one of the following strings: 
   	
 “even > 50”     “odd >50”     “even < 50”     “odd <50”     “50”


2) Implement a method named posNeg that generates 1000 random integers. The range of the numbers should be from -5 to +5 inclusive.
The method will print to the screen the number of positive values, the number of negative values and the number of zeros generated. 
Example output:	positive: <number> 	negative: <number>	zeros: <number>


3) Implement a method named alpha that will generate 50 random characters. The only valid characters to use are the set {a, b, c} 
(3 different chars). The method will print to the screen the randomly generated characters on one line (space separated) and will
also return the number of times that the middle character (b) was generated.


4) Implement a method named reverse that takes one String parameter named fragment.
The method will print to the screen all of the characters of the string in reverse order.
It will print no more than 20 characters on a line (assuming more than one line is needed).


5) Implement a method named rangeSum that takes two integer parameters named ‘first’ and ‘last’.
The method will return the sum all of the integers in the range starting with first and ending with last.
Both the last and the first are included in the sum. 


6) Implement a method named binary.
The method will print (decimal format) to the screen the first 15 non-negative powers of 2. 


7) Implement a method named digits that takes one integer parameter named ‘num’.
The method will return the number of digits in the integer.

You CANNOT use any methods of the String or Integer Wrapper Classes 
Example: (if the integer is 342712) the method will return: 6   // (number of digits)
